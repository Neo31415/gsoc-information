# GSoC information

I'm going to apply for GSoC 2018 and I found there isn't any possible way to filter organizations by technologies they use on [2017 archive page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/organizations/6713622831038464/). So I spent an hour to write this crawler to gather information of organizations and save them to CSV file for quick search.

## Use
Just run gsoc.py after installing all requirements. You can just [download CSV file]() of 2017 GSoC organizations without running.
